## Installation

N/A 

## Usage

When you first open the [deployed application](https://cameron-edek-poole.netlify.app), you are welcomed by the Home page.

![Home Page](./src/images/home-page.png)

![Project Page](./src/images/projects-page.png)

![About Page](./src/images/about-page.png)

![Contact Page](./src/images/contact-page.png)

To test the responsiveness of the site, open up Device mode on Chrome Dev Tools (Option + Command + J on MacOS, Shift + Control + J on Windows/Linux to open Tools, then Command + Shift + M on MacOS, or Control + Shift + M on Windows/Linux to open Device Mode). From here, you can watch how the page responds when you change the height and width of the screen. Alternatively, you can also check this by opening the portfolio link (found above) on a mobile device. You will notice that after a certain width, the navbar collapses and provides the user with a hamburger menu instead.

## Roadmap

This repo will be added to as my skills progress. The final aim for my portfolio page is to display a number of fully functioning projects and to make it more visually appealing. Any suggestions on how to improve the look and functionality of the page are welcome :).
